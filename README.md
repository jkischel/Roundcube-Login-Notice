# Roundcube-Login-Notice
This is a plugin for the webmail application roundcube that simply adds a notice layer to the login page.

Useful for people who need a notice like:
"this is a private computer system. if you try to hack it, you'll go to jail [blah]"

Definitely nothing fancy, but does it's work.

**Installation**
1. create a folder in your roundcube's plugin directory named login_notice
2. replace the placeholder text with your own custom notice text.
3. put the files in your new directory
4. add the plugin to your config.inc.php in the $config['plugins'] = array() line.

That's it. Have fun.
