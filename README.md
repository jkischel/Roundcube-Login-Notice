# Roundcube-Login-Notice
This is a plugin for the webmail application roundcube that simply adds a notice layer to the login page.

Useful for people who need a notice like:
"this is a private computer system. if you try to hack it, you'll go to jail [blah]"

Definitely nothing fancy, but does it's work.
